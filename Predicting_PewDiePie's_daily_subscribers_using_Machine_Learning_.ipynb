    "[PewDiePie](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-lHJZR3Gqxm24_Vd_AJ5Yw) is a Swedish YouTuber and has 100 million subscribers on YouTube (He is my favorite). He gains thousands of subscribers every day, so I thought of writing a tutorial about his gain in subscribers. So I wanted to show you guys a practical implementation of Machine Learning's Linear Regression Algorithm. Here we can apply linear regression to predict his daily YouTube subscribers. I will guide you guys throughout this tutorial how to do so. I will not explain the theory behind linear regression algorithms, because according to me the theory is not so important only the implementation is very important, because you need to know how and where to apply the algorithm. However, I will encourage you to go through some theory online, one of the best articles is shown below:"

    "As seen below when you compare the results of the predicted values with the actual subscriber from the above got by Social Blade, the results are almost same except here and there a few more or less subscriber can be found, but that's OK the machine learning cannot predict 100% accurately. Hence this is how you can use Machine Learning Algorithms to predict the daily subscribers of PewDiePie. If you have any doubt about the code, the comment section is all yours. Contact me for doubts only. Thank you guys for reading my article. Bye, start practicing the code and see you next time."
